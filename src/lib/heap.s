# This is a heap implemented with brk.
# It's slow / unoptimized, and only for
# learning how to set up a basic heap

# It's also very messy due to trying to
# avoiding the usage of s registers;
# the point is to improve performance,
# because you don't need extra read & writes,
# which is pretty pointless because this
# is not optimized to be scalable anyways.
# This makes debugging it very fun :)

# If I were to write this in a sane way,
# I would break up certain parts into functions.
# For example, free would create a new block
# from the old block first, then merge with
# either side using functions.

# Unfortunately, I am not sane.

# Also, I tried to allow for memory up to
# 0xffffffffffffffff at some points,
# which of course won't happen anyways
# because of the stack and the fact that
# that address probably won't even exist
# in virtual memory, but not at other points,
# so if you happen to not have a stack and
# the heap gets there, things are prolly
# gonna break due to unsigned comparisons :)
